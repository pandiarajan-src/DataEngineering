# For this project you will create a command-line tool that reverses a string

# Part 1: Run a script and pipe it into a string reversal bash utility rev
# Run the script ./palindromes.sh to print a common list of palindromes (words that are the same backwards and forward).
# Now run them through a string reversal command:  ./palindromes.sh | rev

#prints a common palindromes
